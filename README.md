# DemoQ

## Abstract
DemoQ is an application I built that democratises Spotify Queues. That is, it incorporates an upvoting and downvoting scheme where groups can push up songs they collectively like, or push down songs they collectively dislike. It piggybacks the Spotify API and is still in a developmental stage.

## Current State
The DemoQ Flask-based web application is almost finished, albeit the interface is terrible. That is, the back-end is mostly complete but the front-end is horrific!

The DemoQ React-based mobile application is far from complete, and a lot more work is required to improve it.
